COURIER QUEST - CHANGES SUMMARY
================================

WHAT WAS CHANGED:
-----------------

✅ NEW LEVEL PROGRESSION SYSTEM:

OLD BEHAVIOR:
  • Every 10 points = new level
  • Odd levels = Street, Even levels = Subway
  • Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
  • Street, Subway, Street, Subway...

NEW BEHAVIOR:
  • Level 1: Street (starting area)
  • Play until you deliver 20 TOTAL packages
  • At 20 delivered → Switch to Subway (Level 2)
  • After that → EVERY delivery switches area & increases level
  • Level 3: Street, Level 4: Subway, Level 5: Street...
  • Areas alternate infinitely


✅ ADDED DEMO VIDEO FEATURE:
  • "Watch Demo" button in header
  • Opens modal with gameplay video
  • Video plays automatically
  • Can be closed with X or click outside


✅ FIXED FILE PATHS:
  • Changed script from "scripts/main.js" to "main.js"
  • All files now in same folder (no subfolders)


✅ KEPT ORIGINAL FEATURES:
  • Same difficulty scaling (timer + level multipliers)
  • Same graphics and backgrounds
  • Same 60-second timer with resets
  • Same 3-lives system
  • Same hazard behaviors
  • Same pickup spawning (max 4 active)
  • Same high score tracking


CODE CHANGES:
-------------

Location: main.js, lines 364-384

OLD CODE:
    // Level calculation: every 10 points = +1 level
    const newLevel = Math.floor(score / POINTS_PER_LEVEL) + 1;
    if (newLevel > level) {
      level = newLevel;
      timeLeft = START_TIME;
      const newArea = (level % 2 === 1) ? 1 : 2;
      initArea(newArea);
    }

NEW CODE:
    // NEW LOGIC: 
    // First switch at 20 delivered, then switch every delivery
    let shouldSwitch = false;
    
    if (delivered >= 20 && level === 1) {
      // First time reaching 20 - switch to subway
      shouldSwitch = true;
      level = 2;
    } else if (level > 1) {
      // After the first switch, switch every delivery
      shouldSwitch = true;
      level++;
    }

    if (shouldSwitch) {
      timeLeft = START_TIME;
      area = (area === 1) ? 2 : 1;
      initArea(area);
    }


GAMEPLAY IMPACT:
----------------

EARLY GAME (0-19 delivered):
  → Stay in Level 1 (Street)
  → No pressure to deliver quickly
  → Learn the game mechanics
  → Collect multiple packages safely

MILESTONE (20 delivered):
  → Triggers first area switch
  → Move to Level 2 (Subway)
  → Timer resets to 60s
  → Hazards become 25% faster

LATE GAME (20+ delivered):
  → Every delivery = area switch + level up
  → Rapid difficulty increase
  → Strategic decision: deliver now or collect more?
  → Timer reset becomes valuable resource
  → High risk, high reward gameplay


DIFFICULTY CURVE:
-----------------

Level 1:  Beginner friendly, plenty of time
Level 2:  +25% speed, manageable
Level 3:  +50% speed, getting challenging
Level 4:  +75% speed, requires skill
Level 5:  +100% speed, hazards move 2x as fast!
Level 6:  +125% speed, expert territory
Level 7:  +150% speed, extreme difficulty
Level 8:  +175% speed, near impossible
Level 9:  +200% speed, hazards move 3x base speed!
Level 10: +225% speed, insane!

Plus timer multiplier (1x → 3x) on top of level multiplier!
